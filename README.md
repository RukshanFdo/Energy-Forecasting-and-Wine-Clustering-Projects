# Energy-Forecasting-and-Wine-Clustering-Projects
This repository contains code and documentation for two distinct projects: Energy Forecasting and Wine Clustering. Each project tackles specific challenges within its domain and provides solutions using relevant methodologies and techniques.

# <h3>Energy Forecasting Project</h3>

In this project, we address the task of forecasting energy usage, focusing on the University Building at 115 New Cavendish Street, London, using data provided by LG Power Station. Specifically, we utilize a multilayer neural network (MLP-NN) to forecast the following day's power usage for the 11:00 hour scenario. We provide code and documentation for:

1. Preparing the dataset for training and testing. <br/>
2. Designing and training the MLP neural network. <br/>
3. Evaluating the performance of the trained models using statistical metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and MAPE.<br/>
4. Comparing different MLP architectures and strategies for input vector representation.<br/>
5. Selecting the most efficient MLP model based on performance and complexity.<br/>
# <h3>Wine Clustering Project</h3>
In the wine clustering project, we explore k-means clustering analysis on a dataset comprising chemical attributes and sensory rankings of white wines. We perform clustering using both the original dataset and a reduced dimensionality dataset obtained through Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The clustering analysis involves:

1. Pre-processing the dataset by scaling and eliminating outliers.<br/>
2. Determining the optimal number of clusters using automated tools such as NBclust, Elbow, and silhouette methods.<br/>
3. Performing k-means clustering with different numbers of clusters and evaluating the results.<br/>
4. Utilizing PCA to reduce dimensionality and repeating the clustering analysis.<br/>
5. Comparing the performance of clustering models based on various metrics.<br/>
